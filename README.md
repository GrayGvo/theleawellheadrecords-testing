## The Lea Wellhead Records - Testing Repository
This repository serves as the central testing and development hub for "The Lea Wellhead Records" project, containing prototype iterations and technical implementations across various development phases.

# Project Evolution

_Version 1_: Digital Cartographic Archive  
Repository: [leaistherecord0](https://github.com/GrayGvo/leaistherecord0)  
Live Demo: https://graygvo.github.io/leaistherecord0/  
Initial prototype implementing an interactive digital map archive exploring the River Lea's geographical and historical contexts.

_Version 2_: Interactive Sonic Archive  
Repository: [leaistherecord](https://github.com/GrayGvo/leaistherecord)  
Live Demo: https://graygvo.github.io/leaistherecord/  
Advanced prototype featuring semiotics of river flow and musical characteristic interactivity, creating a dynamic archival experience.

_Version 3_: Sound System Controller Prototype  
Repository: [WIP-SHOW-NE](https://github.com/GrayGvo/WIP-SHOW-NE)  
Live Demo: https://graygvo.github.io/WIP-SHOW-NE/  
Soundscape interaction controller inspired by sound system culture, developed for internal rehearsal sessions prior to the WIP SHOW exhibition.

_Version 4_: Exhibition Implementation  
Repository: [CSM-WIP-SHOW](https://github.com/GrayGvo/CSM-WIP-SHOW)  
Final implementation of the soundscape interaction controller, specifically configured for the WIP SHOW exhibition environment.

# Technical Implementation

Each repository contains specific implementation details, documentation, and technical specifications for its corresponding project phase. The evolution of these prototypes demonstrates the progression from digital documentation to immersive sonic interaction within the context of the River Lea's wellhead environment.

# Development Notes

For detailed technical documentation regarding implementation considerations, please refer to the individual repositories. Each iteration builds upon previous versions while exploring different aspects of sonic interaction, spatial representation, and user engagement.
